      <h2> Hello World! </h2>
      <time pubdate datetime="2023-3-31" title="March 31, 2023">March 31, 2023</time>
      <p>As I approach my 40th birthday and prepare to move my family from California to New Hampshire, I have decided to start blogging. Why start a blog now? My reasons are not entirely altruistic. I am a co-founder of <a href="https://www.locable.com" title="Locable - All-in-One Local Marketing Platform for Small Businesses and Communities" target="_blank">Locable</a>, a company that utilizes Rails, and building a network will help with recruitment efforts when the time comes. Additionally, when Locable is eventually sold, whether that is in five years or twenty, I want to have strong prospects for my next venture.</p>

      <p>Although I have not yet formulated a concrete plan for this blog, or even what I’m going to write about or in what form, I do know that I wish to establish a personal brand and, if possible, contribute something useful to the Rails community, which has already done so much for me.</p>

      <p>See, when I first joined Locable, I did not consider myself a developer by trade. Despite earning an IT degree from <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/" title="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute" target="_blank">RPI</a>, my development experience was limited to managing WordPress sites and experimenting with custom plugins and <em> trying </em> to teach myself various programming languages. Nevertheless, as an <a href="https://www.bu.edu/" title="Boston University" target="_blank">MBA-educated</a> self-starter, I saw an opportunity to build a business that could make a real impact!</p>

      <p>At some point during the process of working on Locable, I became frustrated with relying on contractors to build our app. We just couldn't move fast enough! So, I dove into Rails to fill that need and fell in love with the framework in the process.</p>

      <p>Over the course of nearly five years of coding with Rails, I have grown tremendously as a developer but now face new challenges such as how to continue developing this skill when the problems faced are more complex and less talked about as well as how to accelerate my learning, both with programming and business, in order to scale the business. I’m hoping the blog can be conduit for that.</p>

      <p>Here are the areas I am considering writing about:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Ruby on Rails, and everything that entails</li>
        <li>Locable - The challenges we face while developing an all-in-one local marketing platform for small businesses and communities</li>
        <li>Front-end, maybe</li>
        <li>Back-end, definitely</li>
        <li>Growth - How we approach business growth</li>
        <li>Business ideas - Occasional opportunities that come to mind</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Despite my OCD brain wanting to have a plan for everything, I am going to take the plunge and see where this takes me. I am sure that a more defined purpose will reveal itself to me at the appropriate time.</p>

      <p> Till next time...</p>

      <p>P.S. This website is a work in progress. It is currently a simple, static website that I created from scratch. My thought is to use this site as a playground for creating a design system for Locable's website builder, but only time will tell if that comes to fruition.</p>
